# What is Warden?
Warden is an API wrapper for [IPHub](https://iphub.info/) that allows servers to automatically prevent clients with identified proxy IPs from joining.

# How does Warden work?

# How do I add Warden to my server?
There are two mains ways of doing this. One, the easiest, is to add this workshop item to your server. Second, however, is to download Warden from our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Silhouhat/Warden) and insert the "warden" folder into your garrysmod/addons folder. The latter method will allow you to configure options such as kick messages, cache timers, and more in the warden/lua/autorun/server/sv_warden.lua file.

# Setting up Warden
Once installed, the setup for warden is extremely easy.
