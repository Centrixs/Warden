[h1]How do I add Warden to my server?[/h1]
There are two mains ways of doing this. One, the easiest, is to add this workshop item to your server. Second, however, is to download Warden from our [url=https://github.com/Silhouhat/Warden]GitHub Repo[/url] and insert the "warden" folder into your garrysmod/addons folder. The latter method will allow you to configure options such as kick messages, cache timers, and more in the warden/lua/autorun/server/sv_warden.lua file.

[h1]Setting up Warden[/h1]
Once installed, the setup for warden is extremely easy.
